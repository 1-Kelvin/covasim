This folder contains code used to make projections for the Seattle area. There are two incompatible versions: `model_orig.py` / `parameters_orig.py` corresponds to the version used to make projections for the governor's office; `model_dist.py` / `parameters_dist.py` refers to the version created by Dan Klein using Mike Famulare's parameters from transGenEpi.
