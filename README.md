# Covasim

Covasim is a stochastic agent-based simulator designed to be used for COVID-19
(novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2) epidemic analyses. These include projections of
indicators such as numbers of infections and peak hospital demand. Covasim can
also be used to explore the potential impact of different interventions.

##  1. <a name="Requirements"></a>Requirements

Python >=3.6 (64-bit). (Note: Python 2 is not supported.)

We also recommend, but do not require, using Python virtual environments. For
more information, see documentation for [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) or [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).


##  2. <a name="Quickstart"></a>Quick start guide

Install with `pip install covasim`. If everything is working, the following Python commands should bring up a plot:

```python
import covasim as cv
sim = cv.Sim()
sim.run()
sim.plot()
```


##  3. <a name="Installation"></a>Detailed installation instructions

1.  Clone a copy of the repository. If you intend to make changes to the code,
    we recommend that you fork it first.

2.  (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.

3.  Navigate to the root of the repository and install the Covasim Python package
    using one of the following options:

    *   To install with webapp support (recommended):

        `python setup.py develop`

    *   To install as a standalone Python model without webapp support:

        `python setup.py develop nowebapp`

    *   To install Covasim and optional dependencies (be aware this may fail
        since it relies on private packages), enter:

        `python setup.py develop full`

    The module should then be importable via `import covasim`.


##  4. <a name="Usage"></a>Detailed usage

There are several examples in the `examples` directory. These can be run as
follows:

* `python examples/simple.py`

  This example creates a figure using default parameter values.

* `python examples/run_sim.py`

  This shows a slightly more detailed example, including creating an intervention and saving to disk.

* `python examples/run_scenarios.py`

  This shows a more complex example, including running an intervention scenario, plotting uncertainty, and performing a health systems analysis.


##  5. <a name="Structure"></a>Structure

All core model code is located in the `covasim` subfolder; standard usage is
`import covasim as cv`. The other subfolders, `cruise_ship` and `webapp`, are
also described below.

The model consists of two core classes: the `Person` class (which contains
information on health state), and the `Sim` class (which contains methods for
running, calculating results, plotting, etc.).


###  5.1. <a name="covasim"></a>covasim

The structure of the `covasim` folder is as follows:

* `base.py`: The `ParsObj` class, plus basic methods of the `BaseSim` class, and associated functions.
* `defaults.py`: The default colors, plots, etc. used by Covasim.
* `interventions.py`: The `Intervention` class, for adding interventions and dynamically modifying parameters.
* `parameters.py`: Functions for creating the parameters dictionary and loading the input data.
* `person.py`: The `Person` class.
* `population.py`: The `People` class, and functions for creating a population of people.
* `requirements.py`: A simple module to check that imports succeeded, and turn off features if they didn't.
* `run.py`: Functions for running simulations (e.g. parallel runs and the `Scenarios` class).
* `sim.py`: The `Sim` class, which performs most of the heavy lifting: initializing the model, running, and plotting.
* `utils.py`: Functions for choosing random numbers, many based on Numba, plus other helper functions.
* `version.py`: Version, date, and license information.


###  5.2. <a name="cruise_ship"></a>cruise_ship

A version of the Covasim model specifically adapted for modeling the Diamond
Princess cruise ship. It uses its own parameters file (`parameters.py`) and has
slight variations to the model (`model.py`).


###  5.3. <a name="webapp"></a>webapp

For running the interactive web application. See the [webapp readme](./covasim/webapp) for more information.


##  6. <a name="Otherfolders"></a>Other folders

Please see the readme in each subfolder for more information.

###  6.1. <a name="bin"></a>bin

This folder contains a command-line interface (CLI) version of Covasim; example usage:

```bash
covasim --pars "{pop_size:20000, pop_infected:1, n_days:360, rand_seed:1}"
```

Note: the CLI is currently not compatible with Windows. You will need to add
this folder to your path to run from other folders.

###  6.2. <a name="docker"></a>docker

This folder contains the `Dockerfile` and other files that allow Covasim to be
run as a webapp via Docker.

###  6.3. <a name="examples"></a>examples

This folder contains demonstrations of simple Covasim usage.

###  6.4. <a name="licenses"></a>licenses

Licensing information and legal notices.

###  6.5. <a name="tests"></a>tests

Integration, development, and unit tests.

###  6.6. <a name="sweep"></a>sweep

Utilites for hyperparameter sweeps, using [Weights and Biases](https://www.wandb.com/). See the [sweeps readme](./sweeps) for more information.
